--------------------------  SUM OF 1 IN DATA IS EVEN THEN EVEN PARITY ELSE ODD PARITY --------------------

Parity (odd, even, none) is a method, by which the integrity of data is ensured during transmission/reception.


-----used to check data integrity of recieved data--------------------------------
When in use, there is a bit in the transmitted data called a “parity bit”
placed accordingly to provide the data to be ODD or EVEN. 

If the data is corrupted somehow, the PARITY will be wrong and a re-transmission will be requested or an error sent.

 
=================> another way is to use - “Error Correcting Code” (“Error Correcting Code”).

It is an encoding that is more complicated than parity.

Most ECC can repair of one bit errors and detect multiple bit errors.
