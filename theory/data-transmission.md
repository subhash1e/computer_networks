Serial Transmission: 
In Serial Transmission,
data-bit flows from one computer to another computer in bi-direction.

In this transmission, one bit flows at one clock pulse. 
In Serial Transmission, 8 bits are transferred at a time having a start and stop bit.

Parallel Transmission: 
In Parallel Transmission, many bits are flow together simultaneously
from one computer to another computer.

Parallel Transmission is faster than serial transmission
to transmit the bits. Parallel transmission is used for short distance.

The 'RS' stands for Recommended Standard, although later these standards were formally adopted by the EIA / TIA in the USA.

The EIA is the Electrical Industries Association 
and the TIA is the Telecommunications Industries Association.

Once RS-232 was established an equivalent standard was written for the ITU (International Telecommunications Union)
to provide a more international standard.

This would enable the same standards to be used worldwide
and also give manufacturers access to a global market using just one product.

This standard was known as V.24 and is totally compatible with RS-232.
