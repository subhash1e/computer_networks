More Physical devices: 

Repeater/Extender  - job is to regenerate same level of signal
Amplifier - job is to increase signal amplitude


==Repeater is used to connect two LAN segments , they must use same protocol

Disadv, repeater are dumb and repeat every signal even not required
collision domain doesnt reduce , it means blocking doesn;t happen it will send data to unwanted signals
2 way transmission

===Hub is multiport repeater -job is to broadcast the message to every nodes

-cheaper than switch hence it is more popular than switch
-high traffic level
-uncontrolled transmission


++++++==========================bridge [[repeater]]

use to connect different lans

while hub connects bw same lan

traffic is divided bw sub-segments
so collsion domain is reduced opposite of hubs.

=======components: uses mac address of segement: 
=========bridge can store and forward , so no collisoin inside the bridge.

=======types : transparent and translation:
