Coaxial cable - tvCable speed of 10Mbps, Obsolete
Twisted -pair cabling - cat1,2,3,4..wire twisted around each other - help in reducing outer interference,
                        they are cancelled.
 Fibre -Optics Cabling - transmit data in the form of light signal

__________________________

different categories cable vary netspeeds.

More Physical devices: 

Repeater/Extender  - job is to regenerate same level of signal
Amplifier - job is to increase signal amplitude


==Repeater is used to connect two LAN segments , they must use same protocol

Disadv, repeater are dumb and repeat every signal even not required
collision domain doesnt reduce , it means blocking doesn;t happen it will send data to unwanted signals
2 way transmission

===Hub is multiport repeater -job is to broadcast the message to every nodes

-cheaper than switch hence it is more popular than switch
-high traffic level
-uncontrolled transmission
